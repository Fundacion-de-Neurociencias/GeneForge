## ðŸš€ GenoML Integration

We have integrated **GenoML**, an automated machine learning framework designed for genomics, to enhance the **GeneForge** workflow. **GenoML** automates the data preprocessing, model selection, and training processes, making it easier to work with genomic data.

### What **GenoML** Adds to **GeneForge**:

- **Automated Data Preprocessing**: GenoML handles complex tasks like data cleaning, normalization, and encoding, making genomic data ready for use in **GeneForge**.
- **Model Optimization**: GenoML intelligently explores multiple techniques to select and tune the best model for genomic tasks.
- **Simplified Workflow**: Users can now run machine learning tasks on genomic data without deep expertise in data science, thanks to **GenoML**'s AutoML capabilities.
- **Zero-Shot Protein Generation**: **GenoML** helps improve **GeneForge**'s ability to perform zero-shot tasks, such as generating functional protein sequences based on textual descriptions.

### How to Use **GenoML** with **GeneForge**:

1. **Install GenoML**:
   ```bash
   pip install genoML
   ```

2. **Preprocess Data**: Use **GenoML**â€™s preprocessing functions to clean and format genomic sequences before passing them into **GeneForge** for further analysis.
   ```python
   import genoML

   # Example RNA sequence
   seq = "AUGCGUAUCGAU..."

   # Preprocess using GenoML
   preprocessed_data = genoML.preprocess(seq)
   ```

3. **Generate Sequences**: After preprocessing, use **GeneForge**'s models to generate **DNA**, **RNA**, or **protein** sequences.
   ```python
   from gene_tokenizer.tokenizer import tokenize_sequence
   from model.gene_transformer import GeneTransformer

   tokens = tokenize_sequence(preprocessed_data)
   model = GeneTransformer()

   # Generate therapeutic sequence
   prediction = model(tokens)
   ```

4. **Optimize and Evaluate**: **GenoML** will help in tuning your machine learning models and ensure that the best possible model is selected for each genomic task, improving the quality and reliability of the predictions.

### Documentation:
Refer to the **GenoML** documentation for more details on how to use the tool and integrate it into your workflows.

This integration allows **GeneForge** to become more **user-friendly** and **powerful**, enabling the design and editing of **DNA**, **RNA**, and **protein sequences** for more personalized and effective gene therapies.
