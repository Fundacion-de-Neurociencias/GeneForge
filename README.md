# GeneForge

**GeneForge** is a powerful multimodal transformer-based model designed for the generation and editing of genetic sequences. Originally focused on DNA, **GeneForge** now supports DNA, RNA, and protein sequence design, providing the tools for designing **personalized gene therapies** across multiple biological levels.

## üöÄ Overview

**GeneForge** enables the **in silico** design and generation of **DNA, RNA**, and **protein sequences**. This multimodal framework helps in:

- Predicting the functional impact of variants (SNVs, InDels) at **DNA**, **RNA**, and **protein** levels.
- Modeling splicing and regulatory alterations.
- Designing **CRISPR guides**, **AAV payloads**, **therapeutic oligos**, and **RNA-based therapies**.
- Personalizing gene therapy for individual genomes across all molecular levels.

## üì¶ Installation

To set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fundacion-de-Neurociencias/GeneForge.git
cd GeneForge
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üß¨ Example Usage

Example: Predict functional impact of a mutation and generate therapeutic sequence:

```python
from gene_tokenizer.tokenizer import tokenize_sequence
from model.gene_transformer import GeneTransformer

seq = "ATGCGTACGTTAGC..."  # Example DNA sequence
tokens = tokenize_sequence(seq)
model = GeneTransformer()

# Generate therapeutic sequence
prediction = model(tokens)
```

You can also explore `examples/inference_predict_variant_effect.ipynb` for more examples.
