# GeneForge

**GeneForge** is a powerful multimodal transformer-based model designed for the **generation, editing, and regulation of genetic sequences**. Originally focused on DNA, GeneForge now supports **DNA, RNA, protein, and enhancer sequence design**, making it a versatile tool for engineering **personalized gene therapies** and **cellular programming** across multiple biological levels.

## üöÄ Overview

GeneForge enables the **in silico design and manipulation** of genetic material, integrating advanced language models, structural biology tools, and regulatory logic. Current capabilities include:

- Prediction of functional impact of SNVs, InDels across DNA, RNA, and protein.
- Splicing and regulatory modeling.
- Design of:
  - **CRISPR guides**, **AAV payloads**, **antisense oligos**, **siRNA**, **mRNA vaccines**.
  - **Protein sequences** and **enzymes** via integration with **ProGen3** and **RFdiffusion2**.
  - **Enhancers** (regulatory DNA) with support for **transcription factor logic** and **cell-specific control**.
- Integration with proteomics tools (e.g., **CHIMERYS**) for experimental validation of expression and function.
- Codon optimization and translation-aware modeling for therapeutic contexts.
- Planning synthetic pathways for aptamers, PNAs, and engineered gene constructs.
- Compatibility with single-cell simulation tools (e.g., **scMultiSim**) for multi-omics and spatial expression analysis.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fundacion-de-Neurociencias/GeneForge.git
cd GeneForge
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## üß¨ Example Usage

### Generate a therapeutic protein sequence:

```python
from gene_tokenizer.tokenizer import tokenize_sequence
from model.gene_transformer import GeneTransformer

seq = "ATGCGTACGTTAGC..."  # DNA sequence
tokens = tokenize_sequence(seq)
model = GeneTransformer()

prediction = model(tokens)
```

### Design an enhancer targeting EPO in mouse hematopoietic cells:

```yaml
- enhancer:
    name: "Epo_Upregulator"
    target_gene: "EPO"
    cell_type: "hematopoietic_progenitor"
    species: "Mus musculus"
    factors: ["GATA1", "KLF1", "TAL1"]
    goal: "upregulate"
    model: "GeneForgeEnhancerGen-v1"
```
