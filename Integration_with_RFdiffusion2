# GeneForge - Integration with RFdiffusion2 for Protein and Enzyme Design

**GeneForge** is a multimodal transformer-based model designed for the generation and editing of genetic sequences. Initially focused on **DNA**, **GeneForge** now supports **DNA**, **RNA**, and **protein** sequence design, providing tools for creating **personalized gene therapies** across multiple biological levels.

With the integration of **RFdiffusion2**, **GeneForge** is now capable of designing optimized **DNA, RNA**, and **protein sequences** that ensure **more efficient gene expression**, **stability**, and **therapeutic outcomes**.

## üöÄ Overview

**GeneForge** now includes integration with **RFdiffusion2**, a deep learning model capable of **scaffolding enzyme active sites** directly from **atom-level descriptions** of reaction mechanisms. This enhances the ability of **GeneForge** to design **enzymes** that catalyze novel reactions with improved **functional activity**.

### **Key Features**:
- **Codon optimization** for RNA and protein sequences.
- **Atomic-level enzyme scaffolding** for designing **enzymes** from catalytic transition state descriptions.
- **Multi-omics support**, integrating **DNA**, **RNA**, and **protein** sequence optimization.
- **Direct design of enzymatic structures** with specific **catalytic properties**.

## üì¶ Installation

To set up the environment and integrate **RFdiffusion2** with **GeneForge**, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fundacion-de-Neurociencias/GeneForge.git
cd GeneForge
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install rf-diffusion2
```

## üß¨ Example Usage

Example: Generate optimized protein sequence using **GeneForge** and **RFdiffusion2**:

```python
from gene_tokenizer.tokenizer import tokenize_sequence
from model.gene_transformer import GeneTransformer
import rf_diffusion2

# Example DNA sequence
seq = "ATGCGTACGTTAGC..."

# Preprocess the sequence using GenoML for improved input
preprocessed_data = genoML.preprocess(seq)

# Tokenize the sequence for GeneForge
tokens = tokenize_sequence(preprocessed_data)
model = GeneTransformer()

# Generate therapeutic sequence
generated_sequence = model(tokens)

# Optimize codon usage for the generated sequence
optimized_protein = rf_diffusion2.optimize_protein(generated_sequence)

print("Optimized Protein Sequence:", optimized_protein)
```

3. **Novel Protein Scaffold Generation**: Design **protein scaffolds** that support complex enzyme active sites, facilitating **new enzyme activities**.
4. **Enzyme Functionality Testing**: Test the generated sequences for **activity** using experimental techniques.

### **How to Use RFdiffusion2 with GeneForge**:

1. **Install RFdiffusion2**:
   ```bash
   pip install rf-diffusion2
   ```

2. **Generate Sequences**:
   After generating a **DNA** or **RNA** sequence with **GeneForge**, use **RFdiffusion2** for **protein structure prediction** and **codon optimization**.
   
3. **Optimize and Evaluate**:
   Use **RFdiffusion2** to refine and optimize the **protein sequences** generated by **GeneForge**, ensuring they meet **functional criteria** for therapeutic applications.

---
